# Good Practices

## Writing good Git Commit Messages

From [How to write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

```Fix typo in README.md``` instead of ```Fixed typo in READMEmd.```

## Gitignore Templates

A good practice is to add a `.gitignore` file to avoid uploading non-useful files into a repo.

There are templates to get started at [this website](https://github.com/github/gitignore)

## Being a good Code Reviewer

[Google's Enginnering Practices documentation](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/) is a good reference for writing a good Code Review.
