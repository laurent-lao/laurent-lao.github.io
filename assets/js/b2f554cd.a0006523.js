My bios did not have TPM (Trusted Platform Manager) enabled, so I had to restart my computer to enable it.\\n\\n## Second Hiccup\\n\\nThe Windows Update tool did not recognize that my PC now meets the Windows 11 requirements. According to the support forums, this issue gets resolved overnight, but I wanted to update now. I had to go and download the [Windows 11 Installation Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11) and execute it.\\n\\n## Upgrading\\n\\nWith the Installation Assistant, things were simple. After about 30 minutes of installation, I was finally ready to restart.\\n\\n![Restart Screenshot](restart-screenshot-windows-11.png)\\n\\nAfter the restart, the installation continued for some time. I am not exactly sure how long because I was working out and by the time I was done, the installation finished and I was greeted with the Windows 11 splash screen.\\n\\n## Third Hiccup\\n\\nAfter upgrading, I could not find the Focus Sessions feature. After a quick search, it looks as though the Focus Session feature is integrated inside the `Alarms & Clock` app. However, upon launching the app, the feature was not there.\\n\\n![Focus Sessions not in Alarms & Clocks](alarms-clocks-focus-sessions-unavailable.png)\\n\\nAfter some Googling, I found multiple support posts with people having the same issue as I. One of the solutions seemed to be to sign-up to the [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/) and pulling the Development build of Windows 11 to access the feature. This was a no-go for me because I want a stable system and not run beta builds.\\n\\nSince many of these support requests were from a few months ago, I tried alternative routes. I went to my `Windows Update` and updated my Windows 11 to the most recent build. Still, the feature was not there.\\n\\nI had all but given up. However, by going to the `Microsoft Store` app on Windows and updating all my applications, the feature was now available!\\n\\n![Update Microsoft Store](microsoft-store-updates.png)\\n\\n![Focus Sessions now available](focus-sessions-available.png)\\n\\n## Setting up Focus Sessions\\n\\nThe setup was quite painless. I only have to link my Microsoft To-Do account and my Spotify account to the app. Since I was not already using Microsoft To-Do, that field is a bit empty, but I was quite pleased to see that the Spotify integration showed playlists in the Focus category. I\'m just not entirely sure whether it\'s because Focus is a category that I listen to frequently.\\n\\n![Focus Sessions integrated with Spotify](focus-sessions-all-set-up.png)\\n\\n## Window Snapping\\n\\nThe window snapping feature named Snap Assist pops up whenever I hover onto the maximize icon on an app\'s window.\\n\\nHere\'s what it looks like for a horizontal display:\\n\\n![Window Snapping Horizontal](window-snapping-horizontal.png)\\n\\nAnd here\'s what it looks like for a vertical display:\\n\\n![Window Snapping Vertical](window-snapping-vertical.png)\\n\\n## First Impressions\\n\\nWindows 11 has rounded windows corners, a centralized taskbar (reminiscent of macOS\'s dock), and dark mode, just to name a few features that are immediately apparent. I will have to spent more time with the OS to really notice all the different changes. I\'m happy to say that nothing has broke so far in my development setup - something that had me worried. However, this could be due to the fact that I use VMWare Workstation 16 Pro to launch my development environment (which runs Manjaro).\\n\\nI have also noticed that the system sounds are different and modern, which is a welcome change, but will take getting used to after spending so long with Windows 10.\\n\\nAll in all, the process was pretty painless although there were some hiccups.\\n\\nMore information available about Windows 11 available [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/windows-11)"},{"id":"cypress-artifacts-with-circleci","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/cypress-artifacts-with-circleci","editUrl":"https://github.com/laurent-lao/laurent-lao.github.io/blog/2021/03/15/cypress-artifacts-with-circleci.md","source":"@site/blog/2021/03/15/cypress-artifacts-with-circleci.md","title":"Cypress Artifacts with CircleCI","description":"Making CircleCI work with Cypress auto-generated artifacts is pretty easy.

Otherwise, it will create it at `https://username.github.io/reponame/`\\n\\n* Create an empty Github Repository (e.g. `laurent-lao.github.io`)\\n* Create the Docusaurus application in your local machine using this command \\n\\n  ```\\n  npx create-docusaurus@latest laurent-lao.github.io classic\\n  ```\\n\\n* Navigate to the new application (`cd laurent-lao.github.io`)\\n* Init it as a Git directory \\n  \\n  ```\\n  git init\\n  ```\\n\\n* Edit the `docusaurus.config.js` with the proper information\\n  * Add a `deploymentBranch: \'gh-pages\'` property to the file\\n  * Add a `trailingSlash: false` property to the file\\n\\n  ```jsx title=/docusaurus.config.js\\n  const config = {\\n    title: \'Laurent Lao\',\\n    tagline: \'Personal Website\',\\n    url: \'https://laurent-lao.github.io\',\\n    baseUrl: \'/\',\\n    onBrokenLinks: \'throw\',\\n    onBrokenMarkdownLinks: \'warn\',\\n    // highlight-next-line\\n    trailingSlash: false,\\n    favicon: \'img/favicon.ico\',\\n    organizationName: \'laurent-lao\', // Usually your GitHub org/user name.\\n    projectName: \'laurent-lao.github.io\', // Usually your repo name.\\n    // highlight-next-line\\n    deploymentBranch: \'gh-pages\',\\n  ```\\n\\n* Execute `git commit -am \\"npx create-docusarus@lastest\\"` to stage and commit the newly created files\\n* Link the local repo with the remote and push it\\n  \\n  ```bash\\n  # Execute this\\n  git remote add origin git@github.com:laurent-lao/laurent-lao.github.io.git\\n  git branch -M main\\n  git push -u origin main\\n  ```\\n* Modify the website to your liking\\n* Finally, deploy it with `npm run deploy`\\n* You might have to configure the deployment through Github by going to `Settings -> Pages` and change the branch to \\"gh-pages\\"\\n\\n## Custom Domain\\n\\nAfter the initial setup is complete and some content is added, it might be time to use a custom domain for you Docusaurus website. Nothing wrong with a .github.io suffix, but it is nice to have a custom domain.\\n\\nThere is instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages) from the GitHub Docs. I personally use Hover for my domains and [this guide](https://nickymarino.com/2018/07/29/hover-github-pages/) helped me get set up."}]}')}}]);
