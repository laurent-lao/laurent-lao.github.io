This makes it very useful for a personal website like mine.\\n\\nThere are many [other websites](https://docusaurus.io/showcase) built with Docusaurus (like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)) since working with Markdown files when documenting or taking notes is far less verbose than with HTML.\\n\\nBelow you will find detailed instructions as to how to create a website such as mine very quickly.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Create a Docusaurus website\\n\\nIf you wish for your Docusaurus website to point at `https://username.github.io/` like mine, you must create a Github repository named `username.github.io`. Otherwise, it will create it at `https://username.github.io/reponame/`\\n\\n* Create an empty Github Repository (e.g. `laurent-lao.github.io`)\\n* Create the Docusaurus application in your local machine using this command \\n\\n  ```\\n  npx create-docusaurus@latest laurent-lao.github.io classic\\n  ```\\n\\n* Navigate to the new application (`cd laurent-lao.github.io`)\\n* Init it as a Git directory \\n  \\n  ```\\n  git init\\n  ```\\n\\n* Edit the `docusaurus.config.js` with the proper information\\n  * Add a `deploymentBranch: \'gh-pages\'` property to the file\\n  * Add a `trailingSlash: false` property to the file\\n\\n  ```jsx title=/docusaurus.config.js\\n  const config = {\\n    title: \'Laurent Lao\',\\n    tagline: \'Personal Website\',\\n    url: \'https://laurent-lao.github.io\',\\n    baseUrl: \'/\',\\n    onBrokenLinks: \'throw\',\\n    onBrokenMarkdownLinks: \'warn\',\\n    // highlight-next-line\\n    trailingSlash: false,\\n    favicon: \'img/favicon.ico\',\\n    organizationName: \'laurent-lao\', // Usually your GitHub org/user name.\\n    projectName: \'laurent-lao.github.io\', // Usually your repo name.\\n    // highlight-next-line\\n    deploymentBranch: \'gh-pages\',\\n  ```\\n\\n* Execute `git commit -am \\"npx create-docusarus@lastest\\"` to stage and commit the newly created files\\n* Link the local repo with the remote and push it\\n  \\n  ```bash\\n  # Execute this\\n  git remote add origin git@github.com:laurent-lao/laurent-lao.github.io.git\\n  git branch -M main\\n  git push -u origin main\\n  ```\\n* Modify the website to your liking\\n* Finally, deploy it with `npm run deploy`\\n* You might have to configure the deployment through Github by going to `Settings -> Pages` and change the branch to \\"gh-pages\\"\\n\\n## Custom Domain\\n\\nAfter the initial setup is complete and some content is added, it might be time to use a custom domain for you Docusaurus website. Nothing wrong with a .github.io suffix, but it is nice to have a custom domain.\\n\\nThere is instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages) from the GitHub Docs. I personally use Hover for my domains and [this guide](https://nickymarino.com/2018/07/29/hover-github-pages/) helped me get set up."}]}')}}]);
